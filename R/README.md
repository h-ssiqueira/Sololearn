# R

* [The Greatest Number](R/The_Greatest_Number.r)

The given code takes 3 numbers as input.

Complete the program to output the **maximum** of the 3 inputs.

* [Sum in Range](R/Sum_in_Range.r)

You need to create a function that takes two parameters and returns the **sum of all numbers** between the two parameters inclusive.
The given code takes two numbers from input and passes them to a function called **rangeSum**().

**Task**
Define the rangeSum() function, so that the code works as expected.

**Sample Input**

4

9

**Sample Output**

\[1\] 39

**Explanation**

For the inputs **4** and **9**, the returned value should be **39**.

* [Grade Analysis](R/Grade_Analysis.r)

You have a dataframe that includes grades of students.

Your program needs to take a number as input, and output the number of students who have a grade greater than the given input.

For example, for the input **89**, the output should be:

**\[1\] 3**

as 3 students have grades greater than **89**.

* [Titanic Survivor](R/Titanic_Survivors.r)

You are working on the Titanic Survivors data set, which includes information on the passengers of the ship.

The data is stored in a **CSV** file, which is already imported in the given code.

You want to understand how the class of the ticket impacted the survival rate. For that, you need to find and output the **mean class** value for the passengers who are adults (Age >= 18), grouped by the **Survived** column.
