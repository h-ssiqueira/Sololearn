## Javascript
* [Trip Planner](Javascript/Trip_Planner.js)

You need to plan a road trip. You are traveling at an average speed of **40 miles an hour**.
Given a distance in miles as input (the code to take input is already present), output to the console the time it will take you to cover it **in minutes**.

**Sample Input**:

150

**Sample Output**:

225

* [The Snail in the Well](Javascript/The_Snail_in_the_Well.js)

The snail climbs up 7 feet each day and slips back 2 feet each night.

How many days will it take the snail to get out of a well with the given depth?

**Sample Input**:

31

**Sample Output**:

6

**Explanation**: Let's break down the distance the snail covers each day:

Day 1: 7-2=5

Day 2: 5+7-2=10

Day 3: 10+7-2=15

Day 4: 15+7-2=20

Day 5: 20+7-2=25

Day 6: 25+7=32

So, on Day 6 the snail will reach 32 feet and get out of the well at day, without slipping back that night.

* [Currency Converter](Javascript/Currency_Converter.js)

You are making a currency converter app.
Create a function called **convert**, which takes two parameters: the amount to convert, and the rate, and returns the resulting amount.
The code to take the parameters as input and call the function is already present in the Playground.
Create the function to make the code work.

**Sample Input**:

100

1.1

**Sample Output**:

110

* [Contact Manager](Javascript/Contact_Manager.js)

You are working on a Contact Manager app.

You have created the **contact** object constructor, which has two arguments, name and number.

You need to add a print() method to the object, which will output the contact data to the console in the following format: **name: number**

The given code declares two objects and calls their **print**() methods. Complete the code by defining the **print**() method for the objects.

* [Store Manager](Javascript/Store_Manager.js)

You are working on a Store Manager program, which stores the prices in an array.

You need to add functionality to increase the prices by the given amount.

The **increase** variable is taken from user input. You need to increase all the prices in the given array by that amount and output to the console the resulting array.

* [Words](Javascript/)

You are making a text encryptor. It should take multiple words and output a combined version, where each word is separated by a dollar sign $.

For example, for the words "**hello**", "**how**", "**are**", "**you**", the output should be "**$hello$how$are$you$**".

The given code declares a class named **Add**, with a constructor that takes one rest parameter.

Complete the code by adding a **print**() method to the class, which should generate the requested output.
